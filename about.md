Heya, my name is Andy.  Welcome to my personal blog.  This is a place where I will jot down notes on topics that interest me.  The main foci will probably be the japanese language and programming.

I'm a 35 year old male, born in Melbourne, Australia.  I'm currently living in Tokyo, Japan.  I work in web app design, and I also teach english when I have time.  Most of my other time is spent learning nihongo.

See you around!
