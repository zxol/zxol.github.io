## Demonstrating what 
### *this, that and over there*

To refer to something without naming it, you can use the Japanese demonstrative pronouns.

```
これ = this (near me) 
それ = that (near you)
あれ = that (over there / in the distance)
```

As you can see, Japanese has three words for this pronoun set, while English has two.

In Japanese, plurality is less strictly defined. You may use these words to refer to a singular item or a group of items. However, to directly indicate a multiple, you can append a `ら` to the pronoun.

Practical note: I've found in casual conversation, `これ` suffices for most situations.  `それ` is generally only used when the person you are talking to currently possesses the item.  `あれ` is generally only used for very distant items.

## Determination 
### *this particular one here*

When John says "I want `this` green tea", referring to a particular green tea in a supermarket display, he's using `this` as a determiner.
In Japanese, `これ` etc. can not be used this way.  A different set of words must be used.

```
この + <noun> 
その + <noun> 
あの + <noun> 
```
Note that these determiners **must** be paired with the noun.  So you can't use `この` alone to say `this` particular one. In that situation, you would use `これ` and point to, or otherwise indicate to the item. 

## Determining possession 
### *my and your*
To demonstrate ownership without naming an item, you can use this set of possessive determiners:  
```
わたしの = my
あなたの = your
その = its
かのじょの = hers 
からの = his
けれらの = their
わたしたちの = our
```
They are constructed by combining a personal pronoun with a `の` particle.  Please note that this particle is a subtle and versatile beast, and differs from English's `'s` suffix.  But in this case it does function similarly.

Note that these don't need to be paired with a noun to be grammatically correct.
